# GitHub and Zenhub

We use GitHub to manage all of our pending work.

## Zenhub

We use Zenhub as an add-on to GitHub in order to add additional metadata to issues, and to make use of a kanban-style board.

## Starting an issue

Refer to the board to see what issues you have assigned.

The issues are listing in priority. Choose the topmost issue from the **Current Sprint** list.

When you begin work, move the issue to the **In Progress** list.

In Hubstaff, make sure that the issue you are working on is selected.
